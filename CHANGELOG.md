**Description**: Changed scope from Windows executable extraction to GUI application development

**Reason**: User clarified requirements for GUI version rather than standalone executable conversion

**Approver**: Bud

**Phase**: Requirements Clarification

**Related**: Session 2

**Impact**: Redirected project focus from extraction to new development

**Details**:

- Shifted from analyzing original ccusage for Windows executable creation
- Changed to creating Windows-focused GUI application
- Maintained goal of reading Claude Code usage statistics
